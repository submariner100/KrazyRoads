# KrazyRoads
Another Cross the Road Game using SceneKit and MagicaVoxel - 
commit1 - Started from boilerplate code. Cleaned the GameViewController and added the following methods, setupScene(), setupFloor() and 
setupCamera(). -
commit2 - Added darkgrass.png to art.scnassets and them added this to the setupFloor() method. To make the grass to appear realistic, I added wrapS and wrapT to .repeat and also SCNMatrixMakeScale to 12.5 for all axis.
